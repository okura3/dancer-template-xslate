NAME
    Dancer::Template::Xslate - Text::Xslate wrapper for Dancer

VERSION
    version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an interface between Dancer's template engine abstraction
    layer and the Text::Xslate module.

    In order to use this engine, use the template setting:

        template: xslate

    This can be done in your config.yml file or directly in your app code
    with the set keyword.

    You can configure Text::Xslate :

        template: xslate
        engines:
            xslate:
                syntax: TTerse
                suffix: ".tt"
                module:
                    - Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2 # to keep partial compatibility
                cache: 1
                cache_dir: "xslate_cache"
